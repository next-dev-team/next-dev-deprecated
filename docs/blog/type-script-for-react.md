# TypeScript for React

Ref source: [Emizentech](https://www.emizentech.com/blog/react-with-typescript-or-javascript.html)
Open-source TypeScript provides a compiler that transforms TypeScript code into JavaScript code. That language is open-source and cross-browser. Suppose there are nearly no logical flaws in the js language. In that case, you may use TypeScript by renaming your.js scripts to.ts files and start receiving appropriate TypeScript code.

The JavaScript language would be a specialized version of TypeScript. Anders Hejlsberg, a technical fellow at Microsoft, introduced and created it in 2012. Because JavaScript got more popular, JS code became bulkier and more difficult to comprehend, which is why Typescript was developed. When programmers began to utilize JavaScript for server-side technologies, this became clearer.

## What Is JavaScript?

Every time a user page does much more than end up sitting there and displaying static data for you to look at — showcasing prompt better content, visualizations, cartoon 2D/3D graphics, browsing video record players, etc. — you could bet that JavaScript is possibly involved. JavaScript is a scripting or coding language that enables you to incorporate advanced structures on web pages. It is the third tier of the cake made up of standard web technologies, the first two (HTML and CSS).

## Is React Better with JavaScript or TypeScript?

At first inspection, there appears to be no distinction between the code from a standard React TypeScript and JavaScript. This is entirely expected given that TypeScript is the Set of Codes and is the ancestor of JavaScript. The distinctions between JavaScript and TypeScript haven’t changed much over the past few years. You’re prepared to go if you know them.

Future technological advancements may accelerate the production of software, driving up the demand for programmers. Please use any language; we anticipate development in both minor and major projects: Choose TypeScript for large projects with international teams or JavaScript for straightforward tasks with great teams.

JavaScript is widely used. They analyze it and find that the language is unstable and unpredictable. If necessary, JS frameworks can be translated to TypeScript. Labor is required to convert popular JS systems to TS.

The.d.ts files must be documented and contain all returned methodologies for each ported library. jQuery’s porting required further effort. Perhaps this isn’t that difficult. TypeScript is supported by IDEA, WebStorm, Expressive, Particle, and others.

How to use TypeScript with React… But should you?

## React Code and File type in TypeScript vs. JavaScript

At first inspection, there appears to be no distinction between the code from a standard React TypeScript and JavaScript.

This is entirely expected given that TypeScript is the Set of Codes and is the ancestor of JavaScript. This implies that any JavaScript-based programming would also be able to execute TypeScript files. Similarly, not all SASS language can be legitimate CSS code; this idea states that all CSS is acceptable on SASS code.

However, the computer cannot execute TypeScript language, which is why most of your TypeScript applications would have tsconfig.json. This configuration file will alter how the TypeScript compiler behaves and translate TypeScript code into JavaScript, which the browser can then understand and use.

The main distinction between TypeScript and the JavaScript React application is the former’s file name. For example, TSX, while the latter is.js.

## How to Create a React Project in Typescript?

You can create a new TypeScript React project by using the create-react-app library in your environment and use this command:

```
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

or,

```
yarn create react-app my-app --template Typescript
```

If you have an existing JavaScript React project that you want to transform into TypeScript, you can run this command.

```
npm install — save typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
```

or,

```
yarn add typescript @types/node @types/react @types/react-dom @types/jest
```

After running the command, you can rename all your .js files to .tsx, restart the server, and get going.

### 1\. Bug Catcher

The proportion of remaining defects that TypeScript can fix increases when more ts-undetectable bugs are set by other means, but this also lowers the overall number of issues that TypeScript can still improve. Therefore, while the proportion may increase, the number of problems discovered may slightly alter.

### 2\. IntelliSense helper in IDE

List Components, Parameter Info, Rapid Info, and Entire Word are some of the functions offered by IntelliSense, a code-completion tool. With just a few keystrokes, you can add calls to attributes and methods, keep a record of the arguments you’re typing, and discover a little about the software you’re utilizing thanks to these capabilities.

### 3\. Type System

You might wonder how to strictly type your variables or objects so that your React TypeScript project’s code can enable Bug Catcher and IntelliSense. To provide the TypeScript Type Process going for you in the Reactive TypeScript project, there are three things to keep in mind.

1\. Declare the interaction for objects/arrays and the subtype for primitive type variables.

To make a field in an object optional, you may use the Operator. It will prevent TypeScript from bothering you when it checks your code.

2\. Whenever necessary, declare the functional component type

3\. You can use this for free. Initializing a property with a value allows TypeScript to select the quality for you immediately.

## Convert Your App Idea Into Reality

**Let’s Build A New App Together**

## 5 Reasons to Use TypeScript with React

TypeScript has been high in demand among front-end programmers over the past couple of years. A few factors contributing to its success are improved reusability, code uniformity, and future platform support. In addition, react stayed impartial, offering programmers the option to use TypeScript or JavaScript. In contrast, many other platforms and libraries adopted TypeScript by default.

In this post, we’ll go through 5 compelling arguments in favor of using TypeScript for React apps.

### 1\. Components are simple to read and comprehend

Prop types are simple to define using TypeScript, which makes the code much more precise and understandable. Additionally, support for IntelliSense and static type checking will be included.

Together, these factors improve the development process and lessen the possibility of defects. Additionally, adding notes to Prop types makes component definitions easier to comprehend.

### 2\. Better JSX support

Another benefit of TypeScript + React improved IntelliSense and code synthesis for JSX. Bit makes it simple to distribute, describe, and reuse independent components across projects. Utilize it to create scalable applications, keep a consistent design, promote code reuse, cooperate with others, and hasten delivery.

### 3\. Support for TypeScript by default in shared libraries

Suppose you were using TypeScript a few years ago. In that case, you might remember how frustrating it was to look for Concepts that emerged for third-party libraries. But now that TypeScript is quickly gaining popularity; the most widely used libraries support Type Definitions. Additionally, Type Definitions are supported by the React library architecture, so you are no longer required to be concerned about it.

### 4\. Gradual implementation for current projects

Choosing TypeScript would not be a simple on-or-off decision. Instead, it is a progressive change based on the program’s state at the time. For example, let’s say you’ve chosen to utilize TypeScript for a current React project. In that situation, you should consider how to operate TypeScript and JavaScript concurrently while progressively expanding the use of TypeScript. Additionally, you may set the TypeScript compiler parameters to migrate gradually.

### 5\. Advantages of IntelliSense and static type validation in general

#### a. Testing for static types

Errors are easier to spot sooner because of static type checking. The example mentioned earlier appropriately recognizes that a string, not a number, is needed as input for the get details method.

#### b. Better IntelliSense

You can trust that IntelliSense remains 100% correct when TypeScript static data validation and IntelliSense are combined.

#### c. Enhancing Refactoring

Refactoring is considerably simpler with TypeScript since we know the precise Languages and where to make changes. Additionally, if a problem is discovered quickly, you won’t risk damaging anything.

#### d. Fewer mistakes that are not defined

Because the TypeScript interpreter additionally identifies Undefined errors at transpile time, the likelihood of them occurring at execution is reduced.

#### e. Improved readability and maintenance

The codebase would be significantly more understandable and maintained using Type Definitions. You may adhere to the principles of object-oriented development and utilize structures like Interfaces to organize your code in a way that minimizes coupling.

#### f. TypeScript use issues get resolved.

Given that we’ve previously spoken about the advantages of TypeScript, let’s learn more about its drawbacks to be better equipped for its adoption.

#### g. Curve for learning

Starting using TypeScript may be challenging due to the steep learning curve, particularly if your workforce has experience with only basic JavaScript. The best course of action in this situation is to adopt the above-described progressive adaptation.

But if the group is already experienced with dynamically typed languages, like Java or C#Understanding Typescript isn’t too tricky.

#### h. Type Definitions are missing from a third-party library.

This is an unusual circumstance given the growing popularity of TypeScript. However, TypeScript’s official documentation offers helpful advice if you run across a Library missing the Definitions. Cite this.

#### i. Computation period

Naturally, it will take a few more milliseconds to construct the source code since it must pass through an additional layer of transpiring. But most of the time, this won’t be apparent. Its advantages in terms of development expertise and being less prone to problems will outweigh its drawback that it requires long effort.

## Wrapping Up

It’s a connection between short-term suffering and long-term reward. When you start a TypeScript project, you may find it very difficult and time-consuming to establish all the authoring tools. Still, as your app grows, you will discover that these boilerplates are of tremendous assistance and speed up and reduce the likelihood of errors. We hope this article captured you incredibly and helped you recognize the value of utilizing TypeScript in your React project.
