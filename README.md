# Next Dev 

Next Dev(Next Generation Dev) is an open source team to sharing all related fullstack resources with the community

## Architecture

We decided to use Monorepo to manage our system, we see [Turborepo](https://github.com/vercel/turbo) is powerful and fast speed monorepo working along with Changesets to manage versioning and package publishing.
As well as a few others tools preconfigured:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting
- [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for managing versioning and changelogs
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/changesets/action) for fully automated package publishing
